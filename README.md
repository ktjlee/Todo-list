Hi y'all, this is Unpersisted Todo-List, a revolutionary way to accomplish your tasks.

The traditional approach to creating todo lists is to add your tasks to represent a certain goal. If that goal(s) is not completed, we keep track of what we want to keep for the next todo list.

With an unpersisted todo list, you don't be able to save or have saved log of items that were not completed. This motivates the user to create _realistic_ and _attainable_ goals rather than list everything that the would ideally want to complete.
